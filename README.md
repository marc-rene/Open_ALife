# Open_ALife
The purpose of this Repo is to make an open source version of the A-Life system in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R video game franchise that can be implemented into any application that may benefit from it, be it Video games, visualisation GUI's, etc...
This should be done by splitting the code into 3 distinct sections: 
    1: The Backend, 
    2: The API, 
    3: The Front-end. 

Both the Frontend and Backend should be capable of being made with any language
